# ANZ-mini-survey-simulator

## Description
Welcome to my first solo python project.

This project's purpose is to create a Dataframe to simulate a survey taken during the application process for a role at ANZ-mini.
Those dataframes can then be processed through Power BI to showcase my current Data Visualisation skills.

## Instructions

1) Adjust candidate_list_generator in line 23 to select how many candidates and to chose your csv file name.
2) Run ANZ mini.py 

## Power BI dashboard
1) Run Candidate Survey Report.pbix
